            Dear Rosanna, ❄️🌹<br><br>

            We met on Speaky by pure chance—or maybe by fate dressed in a fluffy winter coat. 🧣<br><br>

            You're from the beautiful land of Russia, with golden hair that could make Rapunzel jealous, eyes as blue as the sky (on a good Wi-Fi day), and skin as fair as snow. Honestly, Disney should be worried—they missed casting you as their next princess. 👑💙<br><br>

            Our conversation began so randomly, but it already feels like one of those once-in-a-lifetime connections—unexpected, a bit silly, and full of promise. You’re surprisingly easy to talk to, even though I’m terrible at starting conversations. Like, world-class terrible. Like, "should be banned from small talk" terrible. 😅<br><br>

            I don’t know where this friendship will go, but I hope it keeps going and going and going like an Energizer bunny on espresso. 🐰☕<br><br>

            Thank you for being so sweet, kind, and patient—and for making my day feel 1000x brighter (approximately). I'm glad we met. Let's build a snowman someday, or at least a snow emoji ⛄.<br><br>

            From your Brazilian amigo who’s learning the art of random conversation (slowly),<br>
            <b>Felipe 🇧🇷✨</b><br><br>
